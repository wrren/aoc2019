# Advent of Code 2019

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2019 solutions repository. This year I'll be tackling the AoC challenges
using C++20 in order to get up to speed on the new features that have been added to the language since
C++11.

## Building the Solutions

I'll be using [Xmake](https://xmake.io/#/), a new build system for C++, to build and run each solution. Check out the [installation page](https://xmake.io/#/getting_started) for instructions on setting it up. From my short time with it, I've found that it's far less confusing than CMake and overall lets me get things done faster.
